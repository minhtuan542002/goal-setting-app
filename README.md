## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (version 6 or higher)
- **AWS Amplify CLI** (for backend deployment)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/minhtuan542002/goal-setting-app.git
      cd goal-setting-app
   ```
2. **Install dependencies and Set up AWS Amplify**:
   ```bash
      npm install
      amplify init
      amplify push
   ```

## AWS Amplify Setup
AWS Amplify is used for user authentication, API connections, and data storage.

**Auth Module:** Handles user sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out processes.

```bash
   amplify add auth
```
**API Setup:** The API is managed via AWS API Gateway and connected to a Lambda function for handling requests.

```bash
   amplify add api
```
Run amplify push after adding each of these features to deploy changes to the AWS backend.

## Running the App
Once everything is set up, you can run the development server with:
```bash
   npm start
```
This will run the app in development mode on http://localhost:3000. The app will reload if you make changes to the code.
